# Redux toolkit Recap

## What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library that is used to manage the state of an application. It is often used with React and Angular for building user interfaces. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

## What is Redux Toolkit?

Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development. It is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic.
